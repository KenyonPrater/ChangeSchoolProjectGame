# ChangeSchoolProjectGame
A "game" focusing on loss and change for a school project. The game should require Java as well as an install of Slick2D. This is probably not going to be updated any further, because the project is over.

Controls: Arrow keys or WASD, one of the two. Press down to interact.

The goal of this project was to create a "something" to do with the themes discussed in book The Catcher in the Rye. I focused on the motifs of growing up and how that changes how things are percieved. As such, the player moves through three stages over the game. The first is a child, who percieves things in a suitably childlike manner. Next is a schoolboy, who percieves things mostly as they are - the whimsy of childhood is lost, but a fresh perspective has been gained. Finally, the schoolkid becomes consumed by loss, and the world loses all color for him. The player then walks back along the previous path, where he sees the wonder and joy of the past, only to find it vanish as soon as he approaches it. 

Please bear in mind that most of this was coded at times when I was barely coherent enough to type, much less think logically about code structure or documentation, so most of it is a mess. There are also a few signifigant bugs, but thankfully my teacher didn't notice them, so they will not be getting fixed. The art, programming, everything, is done by me. I certainly learned a lot during the process, especially on the art side - I've always struggled to art well, but this time I feel proud of the result, even if there are a few very signifigant blunders.
